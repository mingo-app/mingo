### About Mingo

Mingo is currently the most interesting MongoDB GUI, because itâ€™s been created by developers for developers. The goal is simple, to offer you the best MongoDB admin; built on our programming experience and on your feedback. 

We focus on security, speed and user experience, while keeping Mingo great for both newbies and experienced users. The best part is that our intuitive MongoDB browser is packed with features we felt were missing in other MongoDB GUIs.
